### Communities and Crime (CRJU 430-004)

* Semester: Fall 2020
* Class Meets: Asynchronous, Online
* Instructor: Robert Brame 
* Email: rwb@sc.edu
* Online office meetings at 3:00-3:30(ET) on Tuesdays and by appointment.

#### Class Description

Relationship between criminality and community characteristics, with particular attention to how variation in community structure, organization, and culture impacts crime.

#### Learning Outcomes

This course prepares you to: (1) describe problems of crime measurement at the local level; (2) explain why communities have become an important organizing framework for criminology; and (3) evaluate various policies and interventions at the community level.

#### Reading

I will assign readings throughout the semester. The readings are all available freely online or through the University library (log in may be required). Each reading is linked within the course outline below.

#### Disability Accommodations

If you have or think you might have a disability, injury, or other condition that could affect your class performance, please contact the [Student Disability Resource Center](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/). I will abide by accommodations recommended by the Disability Resource Center in this course.

#### Academic Integrity Statement

You are expected to practice the highest standards of academic integrity. Any deviation from this expectation will result in a minimum academic penalty of your failing the assignment, and may result in additional disciplinary measures. This includes improper citation of sources, presenting someone else's work as your own, and any other form of academic misrepresentation. Please take a few moments to familarize yourself with the University's expectations for student academic integrity which can be found [here](http://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/staf625.pdf).

#### Class Format

We have about 14 weeks of class time this semester. With an in-person class, we normally meet 150 minutes per week. I plan to approximate this same level of lecture time (using video recordings) in this asynchronous online course. All course content will be posted on this webpage. You are responsible for developing and maintaining a regular schedule of: (1) monitoring the course webpage for both content and course-related announcements; (2) doing your assigned reading; (3) reviewing the posted content; and (4) completing your assignments in a timely fashion. Please feel free to email me with any questions (either content or logistics).

#### Class Grades

Your grade in this class will be based on your performance on assignments distributed throughout the semester and a series of 3 short papers (each about 3 pages long). Each assignment will include a set of 5 short-answer questions that must be completed within a 30-minute time window (the 30 minute clock will begin to tick once you start the assignment). You can answer each of the questions in no more than 2 or 3 sentences and you are free to use your book and your notes during each assignment but you are required to work independently -- with no assistance from any other person. The questions will be based on reading and lecture material we have covered since the last assignment. Each question will be worth one point toward your final grade at the end of the semester (14 weeks x 5 points per week = 70 points). Each of the three papers will be worth 10 points toward your final grade (3 papers x 10 points per paper = 30 points). I will say more about the papers below. Letter grades will be assigned as follows: A = 90 or more points; B+ = 85-89 points; B = 80-84 points; C+ = 75-79 points; C = 70-74 points; D+ = 65-69 points; D = 60-64 points; F = 59 or fewer points. You can accumulate partial credit for questions when appropriate. Therefore, if you end up with fractional points at the end of the semester, I will round up or down to the nearest round number (i.e., an 89.1 will give you a B+ but an 89.6 will give you an A). You are welcome to discuss grade issues with me during an online office meeting. Please don't send me [emails](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/can-email-ever-be-secure/) about your grades.

#### Late Submissions

Each week, the assignment will be open on Blackboard on Thursday and Friday giving you two full days to complete the work. The work will be due on Friday evening by 11:59pm (ET). If you have an extenuating circumstance that requires you to submit an assignment late, I will hear your concern and consider whether a late submission is appropriate. Examples of extenuating circumstances include your or a family member's illness or an incapacity to complete the work due to circumstances beyond your control. Forgetting about the due date for an assignment or a paper is not an extenuating circumstance.  

#### Short Papers

I will evaluate 3 short papers you will write in reaction to three of the articles covered in part 3 of the course outline below. The grading rubric for this paper is:

1. Summarize the central research question (1 point).
2. Clearly state the study's major finding(s) (1 point).
3. Identify the major strengths of the study (1 point).
4. Identify the major weaknesses of the study (1 point).
5. Describe priorities for future research in the area (1 point).
6. 3 pages of writing (1 point).
7. Double-spaced, 1" margins, 12pt font (1 point).
8. Minimal number of spelling and grammatical errors (1 point).
9. Appropriate use of section headings for items 1-5 above (1 point).
10. Paper submitted to Blackboard in pdf format (1 point).

*Note*: Each paper is due by the end of the day (11:59pm) on the dates listed in the course outline below and will count 10 points toward your final grade in the class.

#### Required Technology

Weekly assignments will be posted on Blackboard and you should complete your assignments and monitor your grades there. It is your responsibility to have a properly functioning computer and web access so you can successfully learn the material in this course.

* Similarities and differences between the target and comparison beats.
* Police presence in the target and comparison beats.
* Results of the Kansas City Gun Study.

### Lesson 5 - Tuesday 8/25/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/bca5b8M9vvI).
* Announcement: Lesson 5 is the last lecture for the first assignment. 

* Note: Beginning this week, a 30-35 minute lecture will be posted each day from Saturday-Tuesday. The material in these lectures will be covered on each week's assignment due on Thursday-Friday; *please remember you will have 30 minutes to work on the assignment and you must complete the assignment in one sitting so be sure to pick a time on Thursday or Friday when you can work on the assignment uninterrupted for 30 minutes*. You do not have to watch the lectures on the days they are posted. You do need to review them before you work on the assignment each week. I will do my best to have the Tuesday lecture posted before office hours on Tuesday afternoon.

* Here are a few practice questions to give you an idea of the kinds of questions I will be asking on the assignments.

1. What is the dominant contributing discipline to criminology? Example Answer: sociology.
2. What is the difference between empirical and normative arguments? Example Answer: an empirical argument draws a conclusion based on facts and evidence while a normative argument draws a conclusion based on a preference or an opinion.
3. Is the Kansas City Gun Experiment a true experiment? Why or why not? Example Answer: no, it is not a true experiment. Experiments require random assignment of cases to treatment and control conditions and the assignment in the Kansas City study wasn't random.
4. What policy change occurred in the KCGE treatment beat? Example Answer: Overtime patrols by police officers focused on illegal gun carrying in hot spots within the target beat.
5. What data can we usually rely on to measure crime at the national level? Example Answer: The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program publishes police statistics while the National Crime Victimization Survey publishes victimization survey results.

### Lesson 6 - Saturday 8/29/20

Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/6UvGiAf1JPI).

* Most common method for counting crime at the local level is the FBI's [UCR](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/publications).
* Voluntary participation in the UCR.
* Next reading of this semester is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6735v4.pdf).
* Question posed early in the article: did crime change in the city of Charlotte from one year to the next?
* We apply this question to the crime of residential burglary

### Lesson 7 - Sunday 8/30/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/FJW-XilO7Tc).
* Current reading is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6735v4.pdf).
* NC state crime reporting program.
* Residential vs commercial burglary
* bp = number of residential burglaries published in the state crime report
* bk = number of residential burglaries known to the local police
* National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the hierarchy rule
* pr = fraction of residential burglaries reported to the police (NCVS)

### Lesson 8 - Monday 8/31/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/s2TTqiC8j5s).
* Current reading is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6735v4.pdf).
* Reasons why reporting rate is lower than expected.
* ba = actual number of burglaries
* If the reporting rate is exactly the same for different cities, then city-to-city comparisons make more sense.
* If the reporting rate varies from city to city, then city-to-city comparisons make less sense.
* For example, if two cities have different burglary rates, is that because the number of burglaries varies?
* Or, is it because the rate of reporting for burglary varies?
* Or, is it some of both?
* All of these issues also apply to over-time comparisons within the same city.
* Key problem is that we can measure the burglaries known to the police at the city level but we don't usually measure the reporting rate.
* So, comparing, bp across cities or over time within the same city is easy.
* Comparing ba across cities or over time within the same city is hard.

### Lesson 9 - Tuesday 9/1/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/TH17xaIeIu0).
* Current reading is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6735v4.pdf).
* This will be the last lecture covered for Assignment #2.
* Assignment #2 will open on Blackboard at Thursday 9/3/20 at 12:01am and remain open until Friday 9/4/20 at 11:59pm.
* There will be 5 questions with a 30-minute time window once you begin working on the assignment.
* You may recall that during last week's assignment, I only gave you 25 minutes to complete the work -- which was a mistake.
* Since I can't give you the 5 minutes back on Assignment #1, I am giving each student in the class who attempted the assignment 3 extra credit points.
* You should now be able to see the extra 3 points along with your grade on Assignment 1 in Blackboard.
* I am sorry for this mistake.
* The FBI burglary rates are fractions: (# of burglaries/size of population) x 100,000 
* The question arises, how should we count the population?
* Maybe we should be looking at households rather than population.
* The difference between counting households and population doesn't matter if the # of people per household is the same across cities.
* The problem is that the # of people per household does vary across cities.
* In the end, factors such as the fraction of burglaries reported to the police and the use of households vs. population in the denominator of the rate can have significant effects on conclusions we draw.
* For an illustration of this be sure to look at the example comparison of Charlotte and Wilmington on pages 19-20 of the paper.

### Lesson 10 - Saturday 9/5/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/6h1jz3SDed4).
* *Note*: Today's lesson is the first lesson for Assignment #3 which will occur on Thursday 9/4 and Friday 9/5.
* Please make sure you have 30 minutes set aside to do the assignment when you start it. Once you begin the assignment you have to complete it in one sitting.
* Current reading is [here](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ntcm_2014.pdf), [here](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf), and [here](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ntmh.pdf).
* There are several different ways of measuring crime that we need to emphasize.
* UCR (and, in the future, NIBRS) are based on police statistics.
* NCVS (and, in the past, the NCS) are based on crime victimization surveys.

### Lesson 11 - Sunday 9/6/20

* Today's lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/HvagibNOhhI).
* Our measures of murder and homicide present slightly different issues and there are two measures of those crimes.
* The first measure is based on information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control ([link](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm)).
* The second measure is based on murder/non-negligent manslaughter data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program ([link](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/topic-pages/murder)).
* In general, the homicide data is a superset of the murder data ([details](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ntmh.pdf)).
* Here is a [link](https://github.com/rwb/homicide/blob/master/README.md) to a long-term chart showing both time series.
* This chart shows the death certificate and murder data for North and South Carolina during the first decade of the 21st century.

### Lesson 12 - Monday 9/7/20

* Today's lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/Khgflqc_x5k).
* One additional note about the NC-SC homicide figure we discussed in last lecture.
* That figure doesn't take into consideration the size of the population in the two states.
* Here is the very first National Crime Survey (NCS) [report](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/34732.pdf) from 1973.
* Here is the most recent National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) [report](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv18.pdf).
* Here is a link to the long-term trends in property and violent crime from the [NCVS](https://github.com/rwb/ncvs).

### Lesson 13 - Tuesday 9/8/20

* Today's lecture is [here](https://youtu.be/4lob0Sz4Kpg).
* Announcement: if you choose to come to office hours, please note that I generally only see one student at a time. This means you might be in the "waiting room" for a few minutes while I talk to another student. I will let you in as soon as I can under these circumstances.
* The material covered today is the last material on Assignment #3 which will be posted from Thursday 9/10 to Friday 9/11.
* We've spent some significant time discussing the major ways of measuring crime in the U.S.
* Today, I want to spend a few minutes summarizing some of the things we've learned.
* UCR data comes from local police departments.
* NCVS data comes from surveys of a representative sample of American households.
* Estimates based on the NCVS are subject to sampling error.
* UCR data counts crimes that are known to the police.
* NCVS data counts crimes that are known and unknown to the police but is subject to honesty and recall limitations.
* UCR agency participation is voluntary (but compliance is high).
* NCVS respondent participation is also voluntary (but participation rates are high).
* Most crimes are not reported to the police.
* There is significant variability in the reporting of crime among different crime types.
* For violent crime, murder and robbery are most likely to be reported; simple assaults are least likely to be reported.
* For property crime, motor vehicle theft is most likely to be reported; larceny is least likely to be reported.
* The nation's two measures of murder/homicide are the UCR (police data) and data based on death certificates (CDC/NCHS).
* The death certificate data generally yields higher numbers of homicide incidents than the UCR data; why?
* Consider the distinction between a homicide (what is counted in the CDC data) and a murder (what is counted in the UCR data).
* Consider the participation rate of law enforcement agencies in the UCR in comparison to state compliance with death certificate reporting protocols.

### Lesson 14 - Saturday 9/12/20

* Today's lecture is [here](https://youtu.be/05h_-3T5z7Y).
* Reminder that first papers are due on Wednesday 9/30/20.
* Today is the beginning of the material on community surveys and Assignment #4.
* Current reading is ([this](https://www.theiacp.org/resources/sample-community-surveys), [this](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cvpcs98.pdf), and [this](https://www.greenvillesc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/9609/2017-Greenville-Police-REPORT-PDF-6-14-17?bidId=)).
* Last week, we spent most of our time considering various national statistics and trends.
* Today, we turn to the issue of community surveys.
* Most community surveys are conducted through some form of random sampling.
* Let's see how this works.
* Suppose we have a population of 1M people.
* Within that population, suppose that 10% of these people have been victimized.
* Can we survey a sample of these people and still get useful information about the victimization rate in the population?
* Here is an experiment to look at this idea more closely.

```Rout
> pop.vic <- c(rep("yes",100000),rep("no",900000))
>
> s1 <- sample(pop.vic,size=1000,replace=T)

```

### Lesson 15 - Sunday 9/13/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/BoTjvQXGQWY).
* Reminder that first papers are due on Wednesday 9/30/20.
* Current reading is [here](https://www.theiacp.org/resources/sample-community-surveys).
* The experiment we covered in Lesson 14 is an ideal world experiment.
* Some problems that arise in the real world: (1) nonresponse; (2) inaccurate reporting; (3) sampling isn't truly random.

### Lesson 16 - Monday 9/14/20

* Lecture link is [here](https://youtu.be/QeQ_Ri-xBEc).
* Current reading is [here](https://www.theiacp.org/resources/sample-community-surveys).
* Let's consider an example of the three types of problems that typically arise in community surveys.
* Suppose the people who are crime victims are twice as likely not to respond to the survey as people who were not victimized.
* How can we make progress?
* Consider our first sample, where 107 people reported they had been victimized while 893 people reported no victimization.
* Let's suppose that in the real world, only 85 of the 107 people who had been victimized were willing to answer the question.
* Let's further suppose that in the real world that 880 of the 893 people who had not been victimized were willing to answer the question.
* This means that in this real world sample, we would have 3 groups of people: (1) 85 victims; (2) 880 non-victims; and (3) 22 + 13 = 35 nonresponses.
* We could just ignore the nonresponses and estimate the victimization rate as 85/(880+85) = 0.088 (this is a point estimate).
* We can see that this significantly underestimates the true victimization rate (0.107).
* Another approach is to calculate an interval estimate.
* The lower bound of the interval assumes that all of the nonresponses were non-victims: 85/(880+85+35) = 0.085.
* The upper bound of the interval assumes that all of the nonresponses were victims: (85+35)/(880+85+35) = 0.12.
* This analysis would conclude that the true victimization rate is somewhere between 0.085 and 0.12.
* We know the true answer is 0.107 which lies in the interval.
* In the real world all we would be able to tell is that the true number would be somewhere in the interval.
* All community survey research has to deal with the problem of nonresponse and this is one way to deal with it (there are others).
